# Portfolio Optimization
This project is the final assignment for CS164: Optimization Methods, a Mathematics concentration course at Minerva University. It extends the classical Markowitz mean-variance portfolio optimization framework to event-based financial markets, specifically for binary event contracts traded on platforms like Kalshi.

## Project Overview

The implementation models a single event contract as an asset whose value evolves over time, optimizing position sizes across multiple periods as market prices and beliefs change. This differs from traditional portfolio optimization by focusing on dynamic position management for a single event contract rather than static allocation across multiple assets.

## Key Features
- Dynamic portfolio optimization for binary event contracts
- Multi-period position sizing based on evolving market prices
- Implementation of mean-variance optimization for event-based markets

## Report

A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, implementation, and results is available:
- **PDF Report**: [Final_Project_Report.pdf](./Final_Project_Report.pdf)

## Event Status

**Note**: The event used in this project has already closed. This repository serves as a reference implementation and documentation of the optimization approach applied to event-based financial markets.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt` (if available)

## Usage
See the report for detailed methodology and implementation details. The code demonstrates the application of portfolio optimization techniques to binary event contracts in prediction markets.
